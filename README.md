# advent-of-code-2023
This repository contains my solution proposals for the challenges of the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in C++.

## Usage
To compile and run the solutions, simply run `make part1` (or `make part2`) in the solution folder. An executable will be created and executed directly.

## Results
Running on a Ryzen 7 5700U
